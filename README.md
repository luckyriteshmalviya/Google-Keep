# Google-Keep
This is very helpful for creating, editing and saving notes, important links and important text for future references.  
This project follows CRUD concept - Create, Render, Update & Delete.
In this Project we tried to make the UI similar to the Google Keep UI.  
Here I use Agile Technique of Design So I divide the scope of work in different versin like- In first version I made only the basic CRUD Function where user can CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE Notes and then in second version I added some more features like adding Tags, Bookmark, keeping the deleted note in Trash, Speech to text conversion features, dark theme and many more things.
